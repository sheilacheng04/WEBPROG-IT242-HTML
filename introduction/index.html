    <h1>My IT Journey</h1>
    <p>I am an IT student who enjoys exploring different technologies and discovering how things work behind the scenes.</p>
    <p>Ive worked with Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and I'm still learning every day. Coding became not just a requirement in school—it's something I enjoy because it challenges me to think differently.</p>
    <p>My long-term plan is to build meaningful projects that help people and develop solutions that make everyday life easier.</p>
